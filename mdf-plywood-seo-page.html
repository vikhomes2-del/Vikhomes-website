    <h2>The Best Place to Buy Quality MDF Board and Marine Plywood</h2>
    <p>If you're a furniture maker, carpenter, contractor, or home renovator in Nigeria, you already know how difficult it can be to find <strong>genuine, high‑quality MDF boards and marine plywood</strong> at honest prices. Many suppliers sell low‑grade or fake boards that weaken furniture, waste materials, and damage the trust you build with your own customers.</p>

    <p>That’s exactly why <strong>Vik Homes and Furniture</strong> was created — to provide furniture makers across Nigeria with <strong>trusted, reliable, and premium furniture materials</strong>, delivered fast and at affordable prices.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Vik Homes and Furniture?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>✔ High‑grade MDF boards (Standard, HDF, Colored, Backcover, etc.)</li>
        <li>✔ Strong and durable Marine Plywood perfect for moisture‑heavy areas</li>
        <li>✔ Honest pricing — no fake or low‑quality products</li>
        <li>✔ Same‑day delivery within Abuja</li>
        <li>✔ Nationwide delivery for bulk orders</li>
        <li>✔ Friendly customer support via WhatsApp</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why MDF Board?</h2>
    <p>MDF is one of the most widely used engineered wood products in modern furniture production. It is smooth, strong, easy to machine, and perfect for wardrobes, kitchen cabinets, bed frames, dressing tables, shelves, and interiors.</p>

    <h2>Why Marine Plywood?</h2>
    <p>Marine plywood is designed to resist water and humidity, making it ideal for kitchens, bathrooms, outdoor furniture, and heavy‑use areas. True marine plywood lasts longer, holds screws better, and reduces long‑term repair costs.</p>
